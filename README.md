# Panda Intern!

Hey Hey!
Welcome to my contact list!
Following the instructions, I built a contact list. The list displays a list of users from db (provided). Every user has its own card and in the card his personal details - name, job, company, phone, email and so on. 

In addition, I’ve implemented the feature where you can update every user’s name (saving it to database) and also preventing from two users to do this at the same time (using lock).

The project was written with NodeJs (server), Vanilla JS (client), less (on top of css) and also used others frameworks that helped me through. 

Hope to see you soon!

Rony.
