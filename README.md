# Honey Book Intern [Panda]

Hi!
And welcome to my small project - Contact List. 
Following your instructions, I’ve built a web application. The contact list displays a list of users from db (provided). Every user has its own card and in the card his personal details - name, job, company, phone, email and so on. 

In addition, I’ve implemented the feature where you can update a user’s name and also preventing from two users to do this at the same time (using lock).

The project was written with NodeJs (server), Vanilla JS (client), less and also used couple of frameworks that helped me through.
